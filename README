README
======

Overview
--------
This version successfully assembles and runs the example found at http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

Installation
------------
Easiest method: Download from Google Play - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.sticksoft.adce
To install directly to an Android phone, download the raw .APK file in your phone's browser.  Open the file, and you should be prompted to install it.
Note: You may need to allow applications from unknown sources on your phone.  Simply go to Settings -> Applications and check the "Unknown sources" box.

Usage
-----
The first tab shown on app startup is the Control tab, containing the RAM viewer (box at the top) and controls for starting / resetting the emulator.

The second tab is the Assembly view.  Here, you can load / save an assembly file from disk (press the Menu key for options) and assemble a program.
Pressing "Assemble" will reset the emulator, assemble your program, output the assembled binary and an assembly -> binary view for debugging, and load the binary data into the emulator's memory.
Return to the first tab to start it and view changes to the memory.

The third tab displays the text console.  This is a work-in-progress and, as such, colours may not be displayed the same as other emulators.
Keyboard input has not yet been implemented for the console (I'm tidying up and adding other features at the moment) - drop me a line at @sticksoft on Twitter if you're desparate for it!      

Known Issues
------------
Doesn't ask for confirmation before saving over files - be careful! I just lost a program :( Keep backups!
No keyboard input yet
Should auto-assemble and reset on startup (doesn't yet)
