<h1>I/O Quick Reference</h1>
Currently, I/O consists of writing to the console (somewhat standardised), keyboard input (somewhat standard), and interfacing with the ship (non-standard).

<h2>Console</h2>
Write to 0x8000 - 0x81FF for 7-bit ASCII output to 32x16 screen. <br/><br/>
Format (16 bits): ffffbbbbcaaaaaaa <br/><br/>
ffff is 4-bit foreground colour <br/><br/>
bbbb is 4-bit background colour <br/><br/>
c is the blink bit (not implemented) <br/><br/>
aaaaaaa is the 7-bit ASCII value <br/><br/>
<br/>
Colours are 4-bit values of format: hrgb <br/><br/>
h is highlight on/off (use brighter colours or not)<br/><br/>
r is red component <br/><br/>
g is green component <br/><br/>
b is blue component <br/><br/>

<h2>Keyboard</h2>
Keyboard input is written to a cyclic 16-word buffer, from 0x9000 to 0x900f. <br/><br/>
The value written is the Unicode value of the key pressed, truncated to 16 bits. <br/><br/>
Input is only written if the next space is free, so set key codes to 0 after reading them. <br/><br/>
Most recent key location is written to 0x9010. <br/><br/> 


<h2>Harcoded memory addresses</h2>
These are subject to change at any time. <br/><br/>
0xAD00 - Throttle control <br/><br/>
0xAD01 - (reserved for pitch) <br/><br/>
0xAD02 - Yaw <br/><br/>
0xAD03 - (reserved for roll) <br/><br/>
0xAD04 - (reserved for pitch gyro) <br/><br/> 
0xAD05 - Yaw gyro <br/><br/>
0xAD06 - (reserved for roll gyro) <br/><br/><br/>

0xAD10 - Radar control. Set to 0xFFFF to get count, set to index number (starting at 1) for that contact's info. <br/><br/>
0xAD11 - Radar contact count <br/><br/>
0xAD12 - Current contact X <br/><br/>
0xAD13 - (reserved for contact Y) <br/><br/>
0xAD14 - Current contact Z <br/><br/>
0xAD15 - (reserved for contact type) <br/><br/>
0xAD16 - (reserved for contact size) <br/><br/>
0xAD17 - (reserved for contact IFF code) <br/><br/>
